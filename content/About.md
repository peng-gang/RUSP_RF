#### About RUSP RF

This web application focuses on integrating all metabolomics analytes with random forest method to remove as many false positives in first-tier tests as possible. 
Random Forest was proved promising in other multivrariate analysis settings and is applied here to yield second-tier NBS test results with higher specificity without reducing sensitivity.
